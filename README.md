Mockumentary for Climate Change

My thesis project explores the use of “mockumentary” (an audiovisual product that uses the language of documentaries to tell an invented story) as a new linguistic and artistic tool to engage young students in exploring Climate Change issues, expressing their points of view, ideas, fears.
I supported 40 high school students in ideating, drafting and producing 7 false documentaries, where fictional future and present worlds involving climate stories were pictured as if in a real documentary.
My main goal is to understand if this genre can be useful to overcome the “imaginative and cultural failure that lies at the heart of the climate crisis” (Amitav Ghosh - The great derangment), helping students in building and conveying an image of the present and future climate situation that is both real and immaginative. 

The project in this repository is meant for analysing, visualising and finally making an animation to present the part of my thesis data related to this research question:
Did the use "mockumentary" genre inspire and help students in telling about Climate Change main topics and dualities?
